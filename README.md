Just some hacking on ideas

Just did

- Fixed default naming
- Added file and folder renaming

TODO

- Need to apply duplicate names to new rename endpoints
  - Should probably add validation client-side too
- Harden implementation in the server
  - Validation like duplicate file names
- Better UI experience
  - sub-menus for context menu perhaps
  - choosing which kind of file to create (like a wizard)
    - this can include setting the name upon creation too
- Better shared code between file and folder
- New file and folder "services" for mutations to keep components clean
