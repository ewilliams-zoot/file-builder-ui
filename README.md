Just some hacking on ideas

Just did

- Wrote an ass way to handle default file name and duplicate file name entry trying to append numbers.
  It stops after 2 though, so need to figure that out

TODO

- Harden implementation in the server
  - Validation like duplicate file names
- Better UI experience
  - tree doesn't collapse on every mutation call [check]
  - sub-menus for context menu perhaps
  - choosing which kind of file to create (like a wizard)
