Just some hacking on ideas

Just did

- Made modal content for new file its own component now
- Added enter key submit for folder rename (need to do for file too)

TODO

- Need to apply duplicate names to new rename endpoints
  - Should probably add validation client-side too
- Harden implementation in the server
  - Validation like duplicate file names
- Better UI experience
  - sub-menus for context menu perhaps
- Better shared code between file and folder
- New file and folder "services" for mutations to keep components clean
